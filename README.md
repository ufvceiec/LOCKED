## Data Analysis Project

This is a data analysis project that uses Machine Learning techniques to predict outcomes based on a provided dataset. The main goal of this project is to create a predictive model using various algorithms and evaluate its performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main language used for analysis and model development.
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: A library for implementing Machine Learning models.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project in your local environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On **Windows**:
      ```bash
      .\env\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On **macOS/Linux**:
      ```bash
      source env/bin/activate
      ```

4. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the analysis, execute the notebooks in the following order:

1. **TFM_Preprocessing.ipynb**: Preprocess the data.
2. **Modelos_TFM.ipynb**: Train the machine learning models.
3. **GRAFICOS.ipynb**: Generate the visualizations.

Simply open each notebook and run the cells in order to perform the analysis.
